# Varland Metal Service Programming Application

Thank you for your interest in the programming/IT position at Varland Metal Service, Inc. If you were sent this link by Toby Varland, it means that you have already been in for an initial interview and we would like to take the next step and actually get a better handle on your programming abilities.

Each folder in this repository contains a question/problem. Please review them and submit a GitHub repository with your answers. Please put your answers in the same folders as the questions. If you have questions or something isn't clear, feel free to get in touch with [Toby Varland](mailto:toby.varland@varland.com).

Not all questions actually require you to submit code. For questions that do require code, PHP code is preferred, but not required unless otherwise specified. For questions that do not require code, Markdown is the preferred submission format.

Once you submit your solution, Toby will follow up with you.
