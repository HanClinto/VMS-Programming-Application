# A Real World Problem

**This problem does not require you to submit any code.**

We have a number of situations in our company where multiple machines produce similar log files. One of our challenges is giving the right people access to the data contained in those log files.

Currently, each machine is limited to writing only plain text (CSV format) log files to a local hard drive, and log files cannot be shared between machines even though the format is the same.

Your job is to provide authorized personnel easy centralized access to the log data. Walk me through your thought process. What are some of the obstacles you'll have to overcome? While I don't need code, if there were no requirements, what technologies/programming languages/tools would you use to complete this task?
