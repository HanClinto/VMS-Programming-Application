# FizzBuzz

Write a function that prints each number from 1 to `n` on a separate line. For numbers that are multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For numbers that are multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. For numbers that are multiples of 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

**You must use PHP for this solution.**
